Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Applied a UISlider control to select the tip percentage and number of ways to split the final bill. Also to set a range for both functionalities.

## Notes

I tried implemented a switch for selecting between a bright and dark mode for a better user experience using a settings button, but for some reason I couldn't get it to work. Also, for the front-end, having a correct spacing of widgets was a bit of a hassle.
